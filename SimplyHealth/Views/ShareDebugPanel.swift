// ShareDebugPanel.swift
// Removed per request — the in-app debug UI was local-only and has been reverted.
// Export functionality for TestFlight / Release is provided via the "Export Share Logs" button
// in `SettingsView.swift`, which copies the export text to the clipboard and opens the system
// share sheet so you can copy/paste or send logs from TestFlight builds.
